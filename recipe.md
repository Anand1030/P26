First pour two cups of milk into a pan. Then add about 3 tablespoons of water. After that add 3 teaspoons of tea. Then add 1-2 spoons of sugar. Finally add as much ginger as you like I personally add around a piece the size of my thumb or smaller. Lastly just watch let the tea rise and when it does put the gas down so it falls again. Keep doing this and then when it looks a light brown color. Then serve yourself it but make sure to filter out all the tea leaves first.
